Hi Dave

Apologies for the misinformation, while IN enables mobile notification in its country config, we have a backend process to discard almost all SMS except for registered users in IN. This was requested by ODD global rep a few years back. Let us know if you have questions on this, thanks.

Regards,
Fazrezal

Hi Dave

Just FYI, ODD does enable mobile notifications for IN in the form of SMS/Whatsapp. If you require which country enables/disable mobile notifications, please provide justification and we can direct the request to ODD regional lead for approval. Thanks.

Hi Fazrezal,

Thank you for confirming.

I believe we do not have SMS switched on for certain markets including India, which may be why the SMS is not received in this case. Do you have a list of markets where SMS/Whatsapp/Email may be switched off, please?

If we wanted to switch SMS on for India, could that be done at account level, please?

Thanks in advance.

Sure Leanne.

Hi Dave

May we have the AWB of the shipment affected? Just FYI, ODD does its own mobile reformatting and putting the country dialing prefix does not block this, meaning SMS/Whatsapp should still be sent if the mobile phone have country code dialing prefix.

Thanks

Hi Leanne,

How are you doing? Please could you advise re below?

Query from the customer is in relation to the acceptable format of dialling codes for ODD to work when sending text messages. See below:

 We have noticed that our Salesforce UI requests free format mobile numbers and area codes to be input. When we put in +91 on Tuesday, no sms has been sent back. 
 
Please can you confirm what format is expected by DHL and if strict to 0091 etc then we can adjust our test accordingly ??

Hi Jack
 
We have taken another look and it would appear that the Pre-processing configuration (that groups like cards together) prior to the main data processing configuration is not recognising the new field.
 
This is currently being looked at by Dev and I will have a fix over later today that can be tested

Hi Jeremy, 
 
Please can we double check what has been sent to get to the bottom of where the issue lies here, as I must admit I am confused and concerned with the statement that no email address has been included, but we are evidencing that the tags have an email assigned – and we have also checked some other files sent today and all have the email added. ??!!
 
Nitin did confirm on Friday to you that we would not be sending the test ODRs via email and include them in the main prod processing following the go ahead instruction from our servicing dept.
 
Thank and Regards,
 
Dave.

Hi Deepak, David (Gunn)
 
I was expecting the DHL Test files to be sent via email so they could be managed manually and reviewed through processing.  However, as these have come through the BAU process they have auto processed on receipt.
 
I have requested that the DHL eCommerce file and the input UNS file be reviewed and can confirm that No Email tags are present in the UNS file for either the D or E file.  Therefore all 4 records have defaulted to an email contact of customer.services@barclays.com and therefore the DHL email will be sent to this address
 
Phone numbers are present so assuming these are valid numbers then the SMS will be sent to that number.
 
Once the records are collected I will confirm so the messaging can be reviewed.
 
Regards
 
Jeremy

Thanks Dave
 
Hi Fouzia,
 
We would need access to MyDHL+/Proview so that our client servicing colleagues have a view of the shipments that are sent out and can respond to any queries from clients. If you need names and details for who needs access then let me know and I can collate and send.

Hi Abhishek,
 
Is this just for the couple of test shipments that you are sending? If so, the easiest way would be using our website tracking facility; it gives you everything you need to know from collected to delivery.
 
https://www.dhl.com/gb-en/home/tracking.html
 
If you want permanent access to MyDHL+/Proview, we can give you access to this.  There's a lot more to it, so let me know how you wish to proceed for your requirements here.
 
@Fouzia Akther (DHL GB) Hi Fouzia, pending Abhishek's response for support, could you assist here, please? This would need to be in place on Tuesday for test shipments being sent out that day. Thanks in advance

@Dave Cutts (DHL GB) if I recollect, based on a discussion sometime back, we can track the shipments via a dashboard? Apologies if that is not correct.
 
If we can track then would be good to have a view of the dashboard please.

Hi Nitin,
 
Yes, they have been advised.
 
Re collection, Thales may be best placed to confirm this as I am in customer meetings all day Tuesday to Thursday next week in London.
 
@EVANS Jeremy Hi Jeremy, would someone from your operations team be able to confirm once the shipments have been collected on Tuesday, please?
 
@nitin.sharma5@barclays.com Once the shipments are collected and a pickup scan applied, this should activate the notifications to be sent to receivers

++ David/Jo from Thales
 
Hi @Dave Cutts (DHL GB) Are you able to confirm if the Singapore team have been advised to enable ODD settings on 27th May?
Also would you be able to update this forum once the ODR/Emergency orders are picked up by DHL on 27th May so that our test team can test the email/sms notifications?
